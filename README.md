# painting-base2
The general idea of this project is to create a web based tool that will allow users to see number related to images.
The idea is that every possible image is represented by some unique number.



#Dependancies

##OpenCV
We will use Anaconda to manage installing python dependancies.

[install anaconda here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install#linux-install)

```bash
# install opencv
conda install -c menpo opencv=2.4.11
# test opencv
python -c "import cv2"
```
