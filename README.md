# painting-base2
The general idea of this project is to create a web based tool that will allow users to see number related to images.
The idea is that every possible image is represented by some unique number.



#Dependancies

##OpenCV
We will use Anaconda to manage installing python dependancies.
The other option is to use pip and build OpenCV from source: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html

To install from anaconda start here: https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install#linux-install

Once Anaconda is installed then run the following command to install OpenCV: conda install -c menpo opencv=2.4.11

Finally on the command line run: python -c "import cv2"

If no errors everything should be installed.
